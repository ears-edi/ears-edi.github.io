I love learning about how things work at their core. Be it the unseen software controlling it or the moving parts and how they fit together, I am always fascinated to see how it's done. That's why embedded and robotics appealed to me. I get to see for myself how to give functionality to objects and make them respond to the real world.</p>
<p>I came to Edinburgh not knowing an awful lot about technology and feeling like a bit of an outcast since everyone else on my course seemed to know so much. Then I found EaRS and they gave me the chance to learn and ask questions without feeling judged. Having this opportunity helped me become much more confident in myself and has given me a love of tinkering with random pieces of tech without fear of breaking it.</p>
<p>I feel extremely fortunate that I am now in the position to provide this friendly, open space for others who find themselves in my shoes and help them discover the same passion for embedded software and robotics that I have.</p>

I always had a small, secret passion that was hidden for embedded electronics and robotics, which I did not discover until my very first year in university when I fiddled with these little bits and bobs using my own hands and laptop. The amount of creativity you can unleash given the knowledge and expertise is… quite shocking. 
<br>
Being in the middle of all of this equipment and around spectacular people with one common interest is something I am truly grateful to be part of. Given this opportunity, I am more than happy to support and aid people who have a slight interest in the field learn more about it through our beginner-level workshops and events!

Description 
When I first started university, embedded still seemed like a "distant dream". I didn't really know where to start or where to get materials to start building things, until I joined EaRs. I loved that EaRs isn't just aimed at people who are already confident with these topics, but complete beginners too.
<br><br>
Besides that, I love learning about Mathematics and generally any kind of technology. It amazed how much we, as humans, have achieved and have been able to create and I’m determined to understand it all!</p>

Gagan Devagiri - <strong>Workshop Coordinator</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><img class="photo" src="/images/gagan.png" alt="Gagan"></img>
When I first joined the university I was overwhelmed with everyone's accomplishments and how much everyone around me knows and this has motivated me to learn more, everyday! Through EaRs, I'm learning about Embedded and robotics development and have learned to built cool stuff by attending the workshops myself and mentoring few of them.</p>
<p>When I'm not with EaRs, you can find me in Appleton Tower complaining about my coursework or playing Minecraft or if it is the weekends, I'll probably be at a hackathon attempting to build something. I'm often guilty of missing my Monday lectures because I couldn't wake up the next day after a long hackathon. You can message me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notgagan">facebook</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/gag_dev">Instagram</a> or email me at <a href ="mailto:gagandevagiri@gmail.com">gagandevagiri@gmail.com</a>

We are continually forced by great opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems. This is why engineering and tech. fascinates me. You can find a solution to any problem. I'm particularly interested in robotics and electronics. EaRs is definitely the start on a path to learning a lot about these aspects.
<br><br>
Anyway, I'm not just about engineering and tech., on weekday evenings or weekends you can find me in Latino and Afro beats dance sessions, if you would like to have a chat about anything engineering or dance related, contact me at <a href="mailto:ivykalegi@gmail.com">ivykalegi@gmail.com</a>.</p>

Michał Dauenhauer - <strong>Content Creator</strong></p>

<p><img class="photo" src="/images/michal.jpg" alt="Michal"></img></p>
<p>One day, a dozen or so years ago, I found a screwdriver. My family curses that moment, as from then on, any electronic appliance could be found in multiple places at the same time. Some time later I reluctantly admitted that making things work can be as fun as taking them apart. And so began my adventure with robotics and general tinkering.
<br><br>
I like questions and usually I can fairly quickly come up with a very long and only marginally relevant answer, so if you're confused about anything, just let me know so that we can be confused together. Maybe something useful will come out of it and maybe it'll be somehow recorded for the future <s>confusion</s> reference.</p>
